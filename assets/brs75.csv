I was so scared all the time, I could barely move. \nI saw dead people everywhere and there was no food. After a bomb landed on our neighbors house in Juba the government soldiers moved us to Luri, 75 miles out of Juba. Three days later they brought us back and I found several of my neighbors lying on the streets, they had been shot and killed. We found so many dead bodies.‚Äù\n.\n‚ÄùThe days after that there was not enough food. I didn‚Äôt know how we should survive so we decided to move to Yei. I thought Yei would be safe but there we got the same problems and a month later we had to leave to Uganda. We were walking and it took us three days to reach the border.‚Äù\n.\n‚ÄùMany of my relatives were in settlements in Uganda and told us we shouldn‚Äôt come. But I saw people getting slaughtered in front of us so we had to leave. We knew that there was no food on any of the sides and that some of the local communities didn‚Äôt want us to be here. But what should we do? Our children have to continue going to school so that they can go back to our country and change the situation when it‚Äôs getting more peaceful again.‚Äù\n.\n‚ÄúMy life in Uganda won‚Äôt change. When I was ill they only gave me painkillers for Malaria at the health center. When I went to a private clinic I got injections but that was expensive.‚Äú\n.\n‚ÄúWhen South Sudan became independent we were very hopeful so it‚Äôs painful to see what happened.
