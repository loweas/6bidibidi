F√∏rst kommer de til et 'collection center', hvor de fx f√•r taget fingeraftryk. Dette sker, da mange - is√¶r m√¶nd - tager tilbage til Sydsudan for at k√¶mpe samtidig med, at de fors√∏rger deres familie i Bidibidi. N√¶ste stop er i et 'Transit' hvor flygtninge f√•r udleveret basale n√∏dvendigheder samt mad. Her fandt vi ogs√• store telte, da Bidibidi i perioder modtager flere tusinde flygtninge om dagen, som risikere at skulle blive i et par n√¶tter. Derefter kommer 'reception center', hvor flygtningene kan sidde i timevis og vente p√• at blive registreret. Hvis de ikke tidligere har f√•et et armb√•nd, s√• vil de f√• det her. Et bl√•t armb√•nd betyder 'normal' - alts√• en person uden yderligere behov, mens et gult armb√•nd betyder at personen har et s√¶rligt behov. Det kan v√¶re et handicap, at personen leder efter familie i bos√¶ttelsen eller lignende. Det sidste armb√•nd er det hvide, som s√¶ttes om h√•ndleddet p√• uledsagede b√∏rn.

Folkekirkens N√∏dhj√¶lp hj√¶lper sparel√•negrupperne med at starte op, giver dem b√∏ger hvor forskellige bel√∏b kan noteres, en pengekasse og underviser desuden nogle af medlemmerne i at holde styr p√• gruppen og pengene.\nSparel√•negruppe-projektet er et godt eksempel p√•, at n√∏dhj√¶lp ogs√• kan v√¶re hj√¶lp til selvhj√¶lp.

She‚Äôs leaving behind her three children, one of them is her one and a half year old son Jimmy who always cheered us up when at their plot. \nI still remember the first time I was sitting and talking to her. We‚Äôre both born in ‚Äô92 but our lives have been so incredibly different. Here is what she told me about her life:\n.\n‚ÄúI grew up in Khartoum and had never heard or seen of any fights. My life was good, I was staying with my brothers and my husband was working. That changed after we moved to Juba. In July 2016 war broke out and I heard gunshots from morning to night. I was so scared all the time, I could barely move. \nI saw dead people everywhere and there was no food. After a bomb landed on our neighbors house in Juba the government soldiers moved us to Luri, 75 miles out of Juba. Three days later they brought us back and I found several of my neighbors lying on the streets, they had been shot and killed. We found so many dead bodies.‚Äù\n.\n‚ÄùThe days after that there was not enough food. I didn‚Äôt know how we should survive so we decided to move to Yei. I thought Yei would be safe but there we got the same problems and a month later we had to leave to Uganda. We were walking and it took us three days to reach the border.‚Äù\n.\n‚ÄùMany of my relatives were in settlements in Uganda and told us we shouldn‚Äôt come. But I saw people getting slaughtered in front of us so we had to leave. We knew that there was no food on any of the sides and that some of the local communities didn‚Äôt want us to be here. But what should we do? Our children have to continue going to school so that they can go back to our country and change the situation when it‚Äôs getting more peaceful again.‚Äù\n.\n‚ÄúMy life in Uganda won‚Äôt change. When I was ill they only gave me painkillers for Malaria at the health center. When I went to a private clinic I got injections but that was expensive.‚Äú\n.\n‚ÄúWhen South Sudan became independent we were very hopeful so it‚Äôs painful to see what happened.

They were provided 30x30 plot land to build house and planting corps.

And because I was only in elementary school, I never really fully understood what he was doing there. And even now, looking back at it, it's hard to grasp absolutely everything he did. But it did do one very important thing for me. It instilled in me a heart for missions. Seeing all of the things he was doing there made me want to do the same. It helped give me a love for the people in that region that most people don't have. The difference between the first trip I took and this one was astounding. Seeing all of the Southern Sudanese refugees touched me in such a different way. Knowing that the majority of the people that I met have never seen peace in their country, and are now displaced for most likely not the first time, broke my heart. But seeing the love that they have for Christ is insane. They trust in Him more than I've ever seen anyone trust in Him before. Worship is the fuel and the end goal of missions, and seeing the passion that they have for God is mind blowing. I went there in hopes to teach them something, and instead, despite all their pain and suffering, they helped to remind me that the joy of the Lord is the greatest joy possible.\n\nAll these pieces, broken and scattered, in mercy gathered, mended and whole.
